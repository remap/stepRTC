stepRTC
=======

Web RTC for STEP project w/ Inquirium


Usage Instructions
==================

visit http://uclalabchat.appspot.com in Google Chrome

you will get a URL to share

visit that URL on a different computer, and it will share A/V p2p via webRTC. 

then, double-click on the 'preview' window, and it will go full-screen.


Usage Notes
===========

publisher can be Firefox, but the active canvas page works best in Chrome. 

note that you can also just 'hardcode' a single URL, and it will work - do not need to re-generate every seession. 

it will only allow 2 clients at a single URL. 

your screen's aspect ratio must match the webcam's aspect for this to look good. If this is not possible, we can modify this manually. 


Codebase Notes:
===============

currently runs on google app engine - we will eventually make our own codebase. Meanwhile, this works to begin client-side iteration. just draw on global variable 'canvas' (as defined in canvas.js)

The codebase is a modified version of the google/mozilla collab webrtc example (http://goo.gl/tbJXto) - modified, specifically, to include remove video preview on a canvas element.

Also note you can run this locally (via localhost:8080) if you install googleappengine launcher, import the code, and hit 'run'.
